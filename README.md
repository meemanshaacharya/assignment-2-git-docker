Project Title: Content Generation System:
Name: Meemansha Acharya
Description: In this project, we will build a system that automatically converts long-form podcast videos into short, topic-focused clips suitable for short-form platforms such as reels and shorts. The system takes a full podcast episode as input, identifies meaningful segments, and generates short clips along with titles, descriptions, topic labels, and relevance scores.
