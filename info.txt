The focus of this project is on applying machine learning techniques—such as NLP, audio analysis, and basic video processing—to segment content, rank useful clips, and analyze results through data visualization. We are not expected to build a production-level video editor; instead, the emphasis is on pipeline design, model reasoning, evaluation, and clear visual analysis of outputs.
